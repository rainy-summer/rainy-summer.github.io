<p>There wasn’t even any super exciting content on the pages I made with my peers. <br> Just the random thoughts of 14-year-olds that no one would ever want to read. <br> After all, it was just a speck of the vast universe that is the Internet. <br> Some small evidence that you were alive. <br> That you had created something, and anyone could look at it - <br><br>just a shout into the void. <br><br> But it didn’t matter if anyone was reading or not. It was just fun to create something collaboratively together. Something that sat on the nebulous mystery that is the Internet.
